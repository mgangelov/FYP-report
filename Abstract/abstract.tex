This project presents a detailed analysis of audio similarity algorithms solving
the task of cover and live song identification. After examination of the current
state of the art several algorithms are chosen to be examined in detail. The
algorithm analysis is conducted through a benchmark implementing the algorithms
and measuring performance on cover and live song datasets. The algorithm results
are compared through evaluation metrics and give an overview of best performing
audio features and similarity methods suitable for song identification.
